LEGO Data Exploration Project
In this project, we perform data exploration on a LEGO dataset to answer intriguing questions such as:

What is the largest LEGO set ever created, and how many pieces does it contain?

When was the first LEGO set released, and how did the company start?

Which LEGO theme has the most sets—LEGO’s original themes or licensed ones like Harry Potter or Marvel?

How has LEGO evolved over time in terms of set complexity and size?

Through this exploration, we gain insights into key data analysis concepts, including:

Creating visualizations such as line, bar, and scatter plots

Handling multiple axes in a single chart

Using aggregation functions for data summarization

Merging and manipulating DataFrames

This project is based on LEGO set data from Rebrickable, which provides comprehensive information on all LEGO sets ever produced.
